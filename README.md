# MusicStream-Application
This project is a front-end prototype of a Music Website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates a clean UI for browsing trending songs, a persistent bottom music player, and basic user authentication pages (Register and Login). The site is designed to be visually engaging and easy to use.
